## An Idea for Building Trust within Networked Organizations

**Networked Organization:** A network composed of nodes of people and machines that have sufficient volume of interaction where relationships between nodes can be quantified in a meaningful way. This organization is only related in that it shares a common language/jargon but does not necessarily work towards a common goal. These organizations only only extend as far as people and machines are aware of them and spend time towards their maintenance. The life of an individual is a finite narrative, so in order to develop a life story that people can accept as "good" we prioritize and deprioritize certain networks we belong to in order to paint our picture. It is in this limited time that we sometimes ignore or corrupt the networked organizations we belong to. The quality of the networked organization is tied to their ability to create products that creates change in the public that matches the ethos of their community. This quality deteriorates when their outputs become varied and loosely related. Network organizations that are thoroughly corrupted will eventually counteract the ethos of a community, bringing all participants to neglect the network as a valuable source of their identity. People can only be nodes in so many networks, which is really a function of time. People must prioritize what networks compose their identity as to not was the scarce resource of time on groups that do not reflect our personal, uncommunicable ethos. Networked organizations can cease to be networked organizations when interactions between certain nodes become too numerous to make meaningful judgements about, as conventional measurements of their interactions will not capture the relationship's quality. 

**Core:** An approximate grouping of the nodes in an organization with the most connections.

**Community:** Any node with an interactive (two-way) connection on the network.

**Outsider:** Any node with that only has one-way interaction with the network.

**Public:** The entire universe of unconnected nodes who could potentially have a one-way interaction your network.

**Ethos:** Ethos is the unknown. It is ultimately what we are solving for, yet as soon as we have solved for it

### Abstract

This is a concept for a noise reduction platform of Web 2.0 information platform that facilitate the management and marketing efforts of networked organizations. It would be a layer on top of Twitter (initially) and other social media outlets that would allow users to more easily determine the vested interest of each participant in social media discussion and marketing and reduce spam. Noise will work by assigning identities to participants in discussion on open channels which will allow outsiders to determine the approximate function the individual has in the organization. By creating categorizations of individuals within a project we can then create formalized governance systems around pre-existing, but informal, social systems. The resulting categorizations can be combined with staking mechanisms to create all the properties required to allow permissionless networked organizations to mimic the functions of a board of directors in a publicly owned company. Noise focuses on engaging the external stakeholders of software project in a unique way to create apparent structure so that whole network of individuals that has an interest in the project can be involved in building the direction of the project.

### Intro

Over the past few years we have seen the introduction of enormous and valuable network organizations that anyone can take part of and have no familiar structure to the corporate structures we know from the past 300 years. The most noteworthy category that is pushing forward this type of alternative organizational structure is the blockchain related open source projects that are funded by some type of token sale. In the last year the subject of how to govern these organizations, who strive for a more decentralized and "fair" structure than their predecessors have run into age-old coordination issues that have plagued all organizations, but they lack the battle-tested tools utilized by the leaders of traditional centralized organizations to overcome the problems. While there are many theories about how to better coordinate projects without central control, in practice there is no social infrastructure to appropriately engage and inform community stakeholders. This leads to cryptoprojects resorting back to traditional centralized styles of management driven by some source of capital or risk being overrun by and argumentative community that eventually creates a schism in the network with all people working towards a different ideas. Below is an analysis of specific problems that the blockchain network organizations are facing:

_Ignorance of Heirarchy and Bias_

There is no such thing as pure decentralization. Operating in a truly "open environment" is impossible in practice when as there must be varying levels of permissions and authority to get anything done. The most obvious of these is the concept of a Benevolent Dictator for Life who maintains some special priviledge, such as merge permissions on a project, which assumes some final say in issues.  Sometimes the secrecy and efficiency of in-person closed-door interaction is still required due to the unexpected nature of any organization. There are times that special-purpose work groups are neccessary. All self-proclaimed "decentralized" or "open" projects will still have some element of closed & centralized work that would destroy the project if it were ever made public. Also, as anyone who has worked on a software project knows, private conversation is often the best way to vet bad ideas before they become broadly communicated. Temporary hierarchies and methods of determining relative legitimacy of actors are critical for simply getting things done. These relative measures of legitimacy, no matter how approximate, are beneficial to establish so that the community might be informed about who to go to for certain inquiries. An individual's position in the project is good to establish for outsiders to quickly assess the lay of the land when coming into a new network.

_Public Perception_

Most people hear of new networked organizations through Web 2.0 social forums. In open source software networked organizations, tools like Twitter, Github, Stackoverflow, Reddit, Discourse, Slack, Discord, and Telegram reign supreme in forming people's opinions around specific products or features. This is especially true of esoteric or brand new organization where very few people have a working knowledge of the actual product. With the recent innovation of tying cryptocurrency valuation to the funding of open source project, the amount of noise on these social channels has become unbearable for people who are actually using and developing these projects. Discussion around price is often the dominant topic, and there is no barrier to entry into the conversation. Individuals can misrepresent their position, as we never know what interests members in the discussion maintain. Conflicts of interest are always assumed. This has led well-respected members of communities to withhold public support for fear of being misinterpreted as trying to pump a project. This means that intelligent conversation is often done behind closed doors via advisory positions, even though that discussion would be great to have on public forums for public edification. Without understanding individual's position in a project through some form of persistent identity leads to a massive public perception problem. The intentions of individuals promoting specific ideas on behalf of the project aren't easy to investigate, so to an uninformed observer of discussion all opinions are given similar amounts of consideration in the mind of the reader.

_Unified Marketing Messages_

When a project is leaderless, schisms in belief about how the technology is best applied are common. This problem is much worse when the economic factor of token appreciation or deprection is added to the equation. Without the budget for full marketing or PR departments, the marketing focus & initiatives of the project is left up to community creation and curation via social media channels & public forums. When economic incentives of the token holder community members don't align with the development goals of the project contributors the result is spammy and poor quality content being posted through these channels. The amount of content that can be posted is ultimately too vast to take the time to fully vet and endorse, so the quality of content and educational material suffers. This is disastrous for projects trying to recruit new users, as the amount of content a potential user needs to sift through to find something quality can cause the user to avoid the product altogether. 

_Inability to Fairly Prioritize a Roadmap_

Historically, software projects do not stick to their original roadmaps. The fact that software projects miss deadlines on or chagne their roadmap is not a worthwhile critique to address. What is more pertinent is massive pivots from the roadmap and how to manage community expectations when pivots need to be made. The existing Web 2.0 methods of retrieving feedback from a community creates too much noise to incorporate as well defined initiatives, so most of the changes made to the product of a networked organization are always made by a core team out of necessity. If it weren't for the exclusion of the bulk of the network from the long term decision making process, networks would always remain completely divided on what they produce and no unified action would ever take place. Networked organization need a way to effectively incorporate interests of nodes that are distant from the core of a network while not overwriting the tightly held knowledge of core nodes. 

_Lack of Corporate Actions_

The ICO has created an interesting new vehicle for fundraising for networked organizations. Unfortunately we have yet to see it evolve beyond a single, major fundraising event due to an uncertain legal environment. Much of this hinges on the lack of an objective measurement by which a project may be assessed so it is difficult for legal institutions to make judgements about how to categorize it. Despite the best plans of project founders to avoid designing tokens that become securities, they often end up playing that role after the original business model fails. This leaves project founders to quietly pivot their business which often angers token holders. Permissionless networked organizations have an incredibly difficult time conveying what success will eventually look like, and conveying their vision of future success would look like. The ability to manage is even harder when it comes to decisions about capital structure, as major financial actions that might change the capital structure of a company to ensure continued operations are incredibly difficult to do in a permissionless environment. 

### Philosophy

_Structurelessness_

There is always a structure that can be found within a networked organization. It is more often that a group chooses not to take the appropriate measurements to codify such a structure. It is also true that codifying certain measturements are not in the best interest of the organization. There is structure in all networks of people and machines no matter how informal. 

_Money vs Capital_

Money represents demand and capital represents the supply. Money is talked about in a way. Money is noise until it is aggregated and made sense of, and in economies with a single currency the aggregate numbers of demand likely represent whole industry demand and can only signal so much information to organizations who operate 

_Corporate Capture of Our Measurable Social Capital_

Capital has the potential to form the future. Whether or not those with capital will do it correctly is difficult to say, and is too subjective and based on context to ever make blanket generalizations whether or not those with Capital make the correct decision. 

_The Super Rich and Super Connected_

Super rich and super connected nodes have always been able to introduce noise

### System Design

- Ability to group together different accounts and using some type of TCR, associate each account together
- Ability for individuals to claim groupings of accounts by on chain verification or claims (attestations) via social channels, which overrides groupings made by TCRs
- Allow users to collect tokens based on verified and claimed account statistics
- Verified and claimed accounts will be able to display their account via social channels to allow outsiders to immediately verify their identity and gain an understanding of the node's position in the network
- Examples of methods for verifying accounts include: a tweet containing a temporary, permissioned code (thing google 2fa) claiming association w/ the account, a 0 value transaction on Ethereum with a temp hash in the metadata to claim a wallet, proof of transactions from mining pools to prove mining status, adding a hash to a github commit to prove it is your account  
- With this identity, individuals will be able to vote on proposed categorizations for how things are discussed within the networked organization (Vote on Values)
- Tokens will be categorized under account type and can be staked to increase the probability of future action within a given categorization (Bet on Beliefs)
- Example 1: Coordinated & measurable marketing action via social media channels, where major influencers are able to stake their tokens to specific marketing messages
- Another example would be coordinated action around a specific improvement proposal (think similar EIPs fighting to become the standard for a specific), and promising some type of punishment if one doesn't go through (a sale of the coin for a competitor, for example)
- Another example would be coordinating large-scale financial operations in a collective way by issuing quarterly tokens that can be used to vote on corporate actions such as coin-buybacks and restructuring their balance sheet
- Votes will all be measured by QV
